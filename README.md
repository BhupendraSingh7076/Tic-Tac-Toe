# Tic-Tac-Toe
The Tic Tac Toe project is a classic example of a simple game often used to illustrate fundamental programming concepts.

#Objective
The game is played on a 3x3 grid. Players take turns to mark a cell with their respective symbols (usually 'X' and 'O'). The first player to align three of their symbols horizontally, vertically, or diagonally wins. If all cells are filled without a winner, the game ends in a draw.
